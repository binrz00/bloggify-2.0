# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

This application uses the following NPMs:

fs, sequelize, path, ejs

# Installing
You must also have node.js and perform a npm install to bring in all the necessary node modules. 
Run application using server.js as your node starting point.

# Running the tests

In order to run tests (canary.test.js and apiRoutes.test), user will need to type npm test in terminal.

# Example test: apiRoutes

The apiRoutes test will determine if the routing used by the database is connecting properly. 
The api routes currently utilize get, push, post and delete methods in orders to update the database and it's data.
